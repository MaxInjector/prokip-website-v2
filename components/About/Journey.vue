        <h1>Our Journey</h1>
        <p>
          Prokip started its journey on March 30, 2018, in Sokoto, one of
          Nigeria's poorest cities. We chose to startup in Sokoto because we
          wanted to ensure that even businesses in the most underdeveloped or
          rural areas had access to the right solutions needed to grow their
          business. 
          <br /><br />
          Starting in Sokoto gave us first hand insight into the challenges
          business owners face in less connected areas and how our platform
          could help them overcome these challenges. This experience has been
          vital in shaping our approach. We’ve made sure that Prokip is not just
          another piece of software, but a solution designed to bridge the gap
          between traditional business practices and the use of  modern digital
          business management tools.
          <br /><br />
          Today, businesses in major cities, small towns, villages, and rural
          areas throughout Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda are using
          Prokip to manage and grow their business operations. And we’re not
          stopping there—we’re on a mission to reach even more businesses across
          Africa with the complete business management solution they need to
          succeed.
